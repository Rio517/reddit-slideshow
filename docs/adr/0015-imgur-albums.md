# ADR 0015: Imgur Albums Via The Keyless `ajaxalbums` Endpoint

Date: 2026-06-01
Status: Accepted

## Context

Imgur album and gallery links arrive in Reddit listings as a bare page URL with
`post_hint: "link"` and no media payload:

- `https://imgur.com/a/<id>`
- `https://imgur.com/gallery/<slug>-<id>` (or `/gallery/<id>`)

The listing JSON carries only the link - no image list, no thumbnails we can use.
Until now these posts produced **zero** slides (the generic image path rejects a
non-image URL), so multi-image Imgur posts silently vanished from the slideshow.

### Why not the official API

The documented way to expand an album is `GET api.imgur.com/3/album/<id>`, which
requires an `Authorization: Client-ID <key>` header. We do **not** use it:

- **Key registration is closed.** Imgur has disabled new application
  registration, so we cannot obtain a Client-ID at all. This is not a
  preference - the door is shut.
- **A shipped key is a shared quota we'd own.** Even if registration reopened, a
  Client-ID baked into a published extension is a single application credential
  whose rate limit is shared across every install. We would be on the hook for a
  pooled quota we cannot meter. (The Client-**Secret** must never ship; only the
  Client-ID is public - but that is moot while registration is closed.)
- **Per-IP is what actually governs.** Imgur's practical rate limiting is
  per-client-IP for the front-end endpoints, which is why long-lived consumers
  like RES have hotlinked Imgur for years without owning an app quota. Each
  user's browser makes its own requests from its own IP.

### The keyless endpoint

Imgur's own album page fetches its images from an unauthenticated front-end
endpoint that needs no key and no special header:

```
GET https://imgur.com/ajaxalbums/getimages/<id>/hit.json
```

Verified behavior (real album `2orxIa1`, captured in
`tests/fixtures/imgur/album-2orxIa1.json`):

- **Success:** HTTP 200, `Content-Type: application/json`. Body shape:
  `{ "data": { "count": N, "images": [ … ], "include_album_ads": false },
"success": true, "status": 200 }`. Each image carries `hash`, `ext`
  (e.g. `".jpg"`), `width`, `height`, `animated`, `prefer_video`, plus metadata.
  The direct file is `https://i.imgur.com/<hash><ext>`.
- **No header required.** A plain GET returns the full JSON; an
  `X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest` header makes no difference.
- **Empty / invalid album does not error.** A missing id still returns HTTP 200
  with `{ "data": [], "success": true, "status": 200 }`. The discriminator is the
  **type of `data`**: an object (with `images[]`) means a real album; an empty
  **array** means nothing to show. HTTP status and `success` are useless for
  detecting emptiness.
- **Direct image hotlinking works from a Reddit page.** `i.imgur.com/<hash><ext>`
  returns HTTP 200 `image/jpeg` whether the request carries no `Referer`, a
  `www.reddit.com` `Referer`, or an `old.reddit.com` `Referer` - no redirect to a
  "removed" placeholder. So the expanded images render directly in an `<img>`; no
  blob proxy is needed (unlike Imgur `.gifv` → `.mp4`, ADR 0011, whose binary CDN
  path does 403 a reddit referer).

## Decision

Expand an Imgur album link into its member images in the background, before the
content script ever sees the slides - mirroring how Redgifs/Streamable resolve,
but as a **1 → N expansion** rather than a 1 → 1 upgrade.

- **Detection (`lib/slides.js`).** A post on `imgur.com` (or a `*.imgur.com`
  host that is not the `i.` media host) whose path is `/a/<id>` or
  `/gallery/<…-><id>` emits a single **placeholder** slide with a new
  `provider: "imgur-album"` marker. The placeholder carries the album id (via its
  `sourceUrl`) and the post's display context (title, NSFW, permalink) but no
  renderable media - it exists only to be expanded.
- **Resolver (`lib/imgur.js`).** A background resolver fetches the `ajaxalbums`
  JSON and returns the image list. `resolveImgurAlbumSlides` replaces each
  `imgur-album` placeholder with N plain **image** slides
  (`https://i.imgur.com/<hash><ext>`, `provider: "imgur"`, `kind: "image"`),
  numbered with `galleryIndex`/`galleryTotal` when N > 1 so the jump list
  disambiguates them (same treatment as a native Reddit gallery). It is
  concurrency-limited and timed out via the shared `lib/async-pool.js`.
- **Background wiring (`entrypoints/background.js`).** `fetchQueuePageWithProviders`
  runs the album expansion alongside the Redgifs/Streamable upgrades, so the
  content script receives a fully expanded, ready-to-render queue.
- **Host permission (`wxt.config.ts`).** Add `https://imgur.com/*` for the
  `ajaxalbums` fetch. The image bytes live on `i.imgur.com`, which is already
  permitted (ADR 0011). The fetch is a plain background `fetch` gated only by the
  host permission - it does not go through the proxy-fetch byte allowlist, since
  the images load directly in an `<img>`.

### Fail-soft

A placeholder whose album resolves to **zero images** (empty array) or whose
lookup **fails** (network, timeout, malformed JSON) is **dropped** - the post
contributes no slides, exactly as a bare album link did before this change. We do
not synthesize a broken slide or a skip entry, because no media load was ever
attempted; there is nothing the user could act on. The drop is logged.

## Consequences

Benefits:

- Multi-image Imgur albums/galleries play inline as a numbered image run, with no
  API key, no shared quota, and no per-image proxy.
- The expansion is invisible to the content script - it consumes the same
  ready-to-render queue it always has.

Costs / limits:

- **Imgur images participate in Layer-2 perceptual dedup.** `i.imgur.com` is on
  the hashable-host allowlist (`HASHABLE_HOSTS`), so the background hashes album
  images the same way it hashes reddit images - an album picture re-uploaded
  standalone (on reddit or imgur) is caught as a perceptual duplicate, not just
  by the exact-URL Layer-1 key. The hash fetch is the privileged byte path
  (host-gated in `background-router.js`), distinct from the direct `<img>`
  display load. Cost: hashing background-fetches each Imgur image (capped, like
  reddit images) when content dedup is on.
- **Unofficial endpoint.** `ajaxalbums` is undocumented and could change or
  vanish. The fail-soft path degrades to "album shows nothing" rather than a
  broken slideshow, and the placeholder/resolver split means a future official
  path could be swapped in behind the same `imgur-album` marker.
- **Animated members render as `<img>` GIFs**, not as the silent looping `.mp4`
  the `.gifv` path uses. Acceptable for v1; an animated member could later be
  upgraded to a proxied video using its `prefer_video`/`ext` hints.

## Implementation Guidance

- Detect a real album by `data` being an **object** with a non-empty `images`
  array; treat `data` being an array (or absent/empty `images`) as "no images".
- Construct image URLs as `https://i.imgur.com/<hash><ext>` and validate the
  host before trusting them, matching the discipline of the other resolvers.
- Keep the resolver concurrency-limited and timed out; one slow album must not
  hold up the page.
- Do not add a blob proxy for album images - direct `<img>` hotlinking is
  verified to work from a reddit referer.
